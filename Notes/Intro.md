# Intro

Stellar is a tool for iOS developers to automate tedious tasks, born from the idea of replacing Fastlane.

Fastlane used to be the standard de facto but it brings with it Ruby, the annoyance of installing a Ruby environment, and the barrier of not using the same language used by iOS developers. We feel that with the Apple improvements in the Swift ecosystem, we can create a nice and elegant solution leveraging the native Swift Package Manager and Swift command line tools.
